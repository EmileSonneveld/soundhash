        Ever found those long hashes difficult to recognize? Sure you do!
        Luckily, sound_hash can generate sound from them so you can listen to them.
        
        
        
        
        
        linux ways to make noise from command line:
        
        cat sound.txt | aplay
        cat sound.txt >> /dev/dsp
        
        crossplatform python: http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/
        
        
        each byte should generate a kind of sinus wave
        Maby I could cut the byte in 2 or 3: *frequency *amplitude *offset
        
        Totally awesomeness will emerge I suppose
